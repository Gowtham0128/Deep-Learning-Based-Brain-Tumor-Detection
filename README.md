# Deep Learning Based Brain Tumor Detection
Deep Learning Based Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images is a system that detects tumors from MRI scans using image preprocessing, segmentation, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It automatically extracts features, classifies images as tumor or non-tumor, and highlights affected regions through a simple web interface.
